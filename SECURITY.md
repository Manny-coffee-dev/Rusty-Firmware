# Safe Harbor

I support safe harbor for security researchers who:

* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of services.
* Only interact with accounts they own or with explicit permission of the account holder. If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact me immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local information.
* Provide me with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior to any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
* Do not use social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing).

You are expected to comply with all applicable laws. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, I will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report using the information above before going any further.

Please submit a report to me before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.
